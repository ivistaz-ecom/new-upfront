          Workforces are key to economic growth; however, as the world
          progresses post the COVID-19 pandemic, we have transitioned from a
          Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous (VUCA) world to a Brittle,
          Anxious, Non-Linear, and Incomprehensible world. Global economics is
          also moving towards circularity; however, with that comes a growing
          range of inequalities encompassing global wealth, income, gender, and
          ecological inequality across the world. In most cases, labour markets
          and systems may be incapacitated to adjust to the changes, which
          leaves the workforce continuing to experience vulnerability. With the
          belief that a safe and enabling work environment is non-negotiable for
          the workforce to thrive, Upfront strives to make systems, capacities,
          and markets stronger and more inclusive to ensure both workforce and
          business wellbeing, but not at the cost of each other.
